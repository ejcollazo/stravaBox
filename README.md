# Intro

This project was made for our Physical Computing Studio course at Carnegie Mellon University. Our goal was to create a mobile robot that could trace objects on a whiteboard table when coming in contact with the robot.

# Goal

We started the process by designing a course of action and sensors to use. We first designed and laser cut a robot structure that could hold the wheels controlled by DC motors and any potential sensors. We then proceeded to select a switch sensor (to detect contact with object to trace) and a servo motor (to drop marker to begin tracing). Once we determined all the parts we combined it as in the pictures attached. We then tested it on objects on the table. A video of the moving robot is also attached.
