# Intro

This project was made for our Physical Computing Studio course at Carnegie Mellon University. The purpose of this project was to create an internet connected device in which we used an online API to connect a device with a Raspberry Pi for an interesting use case.

# Goal

I started deciding what I wanted to create and what useful information I could get from users. Being a cyclist I wanted to create something that reminded athletes to work hard and stay goal orientated. I decided to create a subtle box of gentle reminders that would motivate and push athletes to train. Using a board of LEDs and a Raspberry Pi I was able to create a desk box to create this subtle reminder. The 3 main reminders the screen cycles through were total distance for the year, bar graph of last 5 activites, and whether or not they did an activity that day.
